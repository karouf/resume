Tired of driving one hour up to Nantes every week to practice, we decided with two friends also playing for the Dockers de Nantes to set up a new american football team in Niort which was the biggest city around without a club.
After about a year of operation, we were proud to be able to field a proper american football team which was playing in the regional championship, quite unusual and a big achievement for a first-year team in France!

Having founded the Pictes de Niort american football club, we thought it was time to get people together and think about the way we wanted to do things in our region.
